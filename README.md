This is a game called Birdfeed. The objective of the game is to shoot worms into birds mouths as they fly overhead through the screen. The player will be positioned stationary at the bottom of the screen. The player would be able to aim at the birds by using their mouse and shoot the worm gun by clicking. There would be a time limit of about 60 seconds and a score that will increase with each successful shot. For bonus features, I was thinking of introducing a hawk that you should avoid feeding, or clocks that randomly appear and increase your time limit by 3 seconds if you shoot them. I would also like to have background music and a high score leaderboard.

In Birdfeed, users will be able to:

- Aim at birds flying above with their mouse
- Shoot food at the birds flying above on a click
- Gain points when they successfully shoot a worm at the worm

I intend to build this game using the Canvas API.

Between Friday and the weekend I am hoping to have my player rendered in the appropriate position and be able to animate the birds flying through the air.

On Monday, I want to begin to implement the collision detection necessary when the fired worm intersects with a flying bird.

On Tuesday, I want to be able to increase the score when a shot is successful and implement the 60 second countdown clock.

On Wednesday, I would like to implement a high score tracker that is updated after each round of the game.
